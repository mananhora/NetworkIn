	CSC 210 : MILESTONE 1
Team Members: Manan Hora, Nina Bose
Due Date: Tuesday, October 20th, 2015

What is the proposed name for your Web application? 
Relationship Management Tool


Who is the target audience for your Web application?
Anyone and everyone who is well-connected and has a wide network. 
[Optional stretch goal: Identify a target audience that none of your group members belong to. This will make your project more unique than a Web app for college students.]


What problem is it intended to solve for that audience?
It takes too much time and effort to stay in touch with people weÕve met. You have to ÔrememberÕ the people you want to stay in touch with out of all the people youÕve ever met in school, college, workplace, conferences etc. Then, you have to keep track of when you contacted them last, and remind yourself to touch base with them every now and then. Even if you do take the time and effort to do that, what if your friend asks you tomorrow if you know someone with expertise in writing business contracts, and you find yourself unable to think of anyone at that point. After all, you know so many people, and itÕs very difficult to visualize your entire network in your head.


How will it meet the minimum project requirements?
Users will register and create their profile (CREATE)
They will be able to add members to their network and see them the next time they login (READ)
They will be able to update their profile and add or remove members each time they log in (UPDATE)
They will be able to delete their profile (DELETE)

Why is your proposed Web application unique or creative beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements?
We seek to build an application that helps you nurture your relationships and enrich your network with minimal time and effort. The web application will serve as a visualization of all the connections that you want to maintain or build in your life by providing a birdÕs-eye view of how you are connected with different people through categories defined by you.

Features
->See when you last touched base with your friend/business client/weak tie/mentor.
->Set alerts for pinging people in your network, and get reminders.
->Search people in your network by skills, location, college/school/workplace or any ÔtagÕ defined by you.
->Easily make introductions between people in your network by clicking a few buttons, and an automatic email/fb message will be sent to both the people.
